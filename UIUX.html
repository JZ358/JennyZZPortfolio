        Summary
      </h2>
    
      <h3>
        The Felicity app aims to improve work and study habits
         while providing customizable support through studies on productivity.
         As one of the team leads in the UI/UX department, I created wireframes 
         that implemented research findings and built visual interactive elements that supported the app features.

      <h4>Our Team</h4>
      <h5>It was very exciting to be a part of this vibrant and diverse team of students
         from different programs and universities! Connecting and communicating through
          only online platforms was a huge challenge but also a valuable experience for 
          adapting to remote work and maneuvering through digital tools such as Zoom, Figma and Miro.

      <h4>Understanding Research Background </h4>
      <h5>The main step after onboarding into the UI/UX team was understanding the core 
        elements of the app which focuses on motivation and organization. There was a lot of back and 
        forth discussions between the ui/ux team and the research team on translating research findings into 
        useful app features. This process allowed me to examine and leverage the three aspects of research, design and practicality.

     <h4>Breaking Down App Components</h4>
     <h5>
    After going through the research principles that the app aims to convey, I would translate them into these main components: 
    <ul class="a">
      <li><b>Function:</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Organization</li>
            <ul>
              <li>To-do List</li>
              <li>Calendar</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Settings</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Menu, themes </li>
              <li>Notification </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Gamification of tasks:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Avatar</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Customizable with different outfits</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Interactive animations and icons </li>
              <li>Quizzes and surveys </li>
            </ul>
          <li><b>Personalization</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Study tips and educational info</li>
            </ul>
      <li><b>Visuals</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimalistic and consistent color palette </li>

    <h4>Integrating Research into App Features </h4>
    <h5>The biggest challenge was transforming all the content and research into accessible and intuitive features.
      Excessive options and steps would lead to an overcomplicated application that is hard to use. 
      Some ideas that I proposed were to visualize concepts such as adding a progress bar for completed tasks,
       and categorizing priorities by assigning colors and adding filters to tasks. 
      Communicating information through visuals could allow for quicker and easier access to complex concepts. 
      The slide below condenses each intervention's objective into charts.

    <h4>Modernizing UI</h4>
    <h5>Through the process of constant readjustments, we’ve achieved a cleaner and more modernized design. 
      Some takeaways in this process include using a minimalist and muted color scheme for consistency and clarity. 
      The use of shadows to create spatial hierarchy was also very effective.

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <h5>As one of the UI/UX team lead who was in charge of designing the Psycap section, 
      I delivered concepts, aims and assigned roles to each of my team members. 
      It was a valuable learning experience getting in touch with them every week to update 
      and provide feedback to build on each of our designs. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Considering the amount of students involved and the reliance on digital platforms, 
the Felicity team had a very effective communication system. 
Through planning in google docs, group chats and breakout rooms, 
it was very impressive to see the progress we’ve made each week. 
Reflecting upon the final deliverables, there is definitely room for further development. 
For example, some of the overlapping features could be merged to serve more targeted purposes. 
The addition of multiple tools and interventions could also discourage incentives by blurring the main objective.
